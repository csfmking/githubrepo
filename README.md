Right now, I don't know what I am doing.

I can't get the Validates Immediately to work as described in Chapter 10 of the BNR Cocoa Programming for OS X. I am planing to download the Xcode project and compare my project with BNR's. I have made the Swift-2 modifications but my validateValue fuction is not getting called.
